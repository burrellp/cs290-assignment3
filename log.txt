You log goes in this  file.

Note: My work/life schedule is such that my only long contiguous blocks of available time are Friday-Sunday, so that is when I get most of my coding work done. The earlier part of the week is spent on lectures and reading. I did not see the instructor’s comment on Piazza that these activities could be included in the work log until I began the assignment in earnest and became aware of the work log requirement. Therefore, this work log is more or less limited to time spent in front of my computer writing code (and researching when stuck) for the assignment.
